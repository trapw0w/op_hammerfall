### Situation - Enemy Forces
Enemy Forces consist of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP; Urdu 'Taliban Movement of Pakistan') Insurgents.  They occupy the entire AO East of the Dasht (desert plains), and have established a deeply entrenched network of cells.Enemy forces wear traditional local clothing, and are armed with AK variant weapon systems, RPG-7s and PKMs at the small unit level.  They have a confirmed sharpshooter/trained shot capability in the form of insurgents armed with SVDs, Lee Enfields and other long range precision weapon systems. They are able to employ a variety of crew-served weapons including but not limited to DHSKM, KPVT, ZU-23 and ground based air defence.  They have a viable SA-7 MANPAD capability. The insurgents favour engaging security forces with coordinated IED strikes and ambushes.  The SVIED threat is assessed to be HIGH.  The VBIED threat is assessed to be EXTREMELY HIGH. The VOIED threat is assessed to be HIGH.

### Mission
FIND and FIX insurgent base locations, IED factories, weapons caches, prestige weapons and High Value/Payoff Targets. FINISH these targets through a combination of soft and kinetic effects. EXPLOIT any available information and/or intelligence on site through SSE. ANALYSE said information and/or intelligence. DISSEMINATE this information efficiently through the reporting system in order to generate follow-on objectives and DEFEAT insurgent forces.

### Execution
Execution will be decided by TFHQ in coordination with Sub-Unit and Team Leaders.  It is , however, advised by JSOC that TFHQ allows experienced and proficient operators considerable latitiude in taking the initiative and decision making, while maintaining close supervision of those that require more guidance.  Otherwise F3EAD is unlikely to be successfuly in a COIN environment.

### Combat Service Support
Initial stores are available at the Forward Mounting Base.  Air Resupply is available by request to all Team Leaders and Comms operators via USAF C-130J.  Fast Air CAS will be provided by USAF A-10s to all Team Leaders and Comms operators as required.  Local National Arty support is also available to all TLs and Comms operators.  Food and Water is provided at the FMB with additional resupplies available by air.

### Medical
There is a field hospital established at the FMB, with additional MED vehicles available for deployment and staffed by PJs.  The Squadron Senior Medical Sergeant and his team are on immediate notice to move for MEDEVAC, available to TLs and Comms operators
